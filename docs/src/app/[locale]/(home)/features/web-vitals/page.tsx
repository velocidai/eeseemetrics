            Lighthouse gives you a score. PageSpeed Insights gives you lab data. But neither tells you how your site <strong className="text-neutral-900 dark:text-white">actually performs for real visitors</strong> on real devices, real networks, and real browsers. Eesee Metrics&apos; Web Vitals monitoring measures Core Web Vitals from actual user sessions — the same metrics Google uses to determine your search ranking.
          </>,
          <>
            See your <strong className="text-neutral-900 dark:text-white">LCP, FID/INP, and CLS</strong> at the P75, P90, and P99 levels. Break them down by device type, browser, operating system, and geographic region. Spot that your mobile users in Southeast Asia have a 4-second LCP while desktop users in Europe see 1.2 seconds — then take targeted action.
          </>,
          <>
            Track performance <strong className="text-neutral-900 dark:text-white">over time with trend charts</strong> that make regressions instantly visible. Correlate performance changes with deployments. All data comes from real user monitoring with minimal overhead, and because it&apos;s built into Eesee Metrics, there&apos;s no extra tool to manage or separate bill to pay.
